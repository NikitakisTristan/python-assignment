# python-assignment

This assignment is broken up into 3 components:

1) 
  The extract_raw_data component serves to extract data from the url provided
  and store them in a directory that will be created on the users desktop. 

2)  
  The xml_dataframe_component serves to change the xml data to a pandas dataframe,
  and then export the dataframe as a .csv file.
  
3)
  The merge_csv_component will merge all the .csv files exported in the xml_dataframe_component
  into one .csv file.
  
There is a python_assignment file that will import each component and run them in the correct order.
